      "these apple fritters are now one of my most viral recipes of all time. they're a healthier twist on traditional apple fritters: baked instead of fried, made with better-for-you ingredients, and naturally sweetened. you can always add extra sweetener to the batter or on top if you prefer, and using naturally sweet, juicy apples really makes a difference. they make for a great healthy dessert, breakfast on the go idea or sweet snack. For the most consistent results, stick to the gram measurements and take a quick look at the FAQ for helpful troubleshooting before you begin."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How do I store sugar-free apple fritters?",
      "answer": "Store the apple fritters in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 24 hours. For longer storage, refrigerate them for up to 3 to 4 days. Reheat in the oven or air fryer for a few minutes to restore their texture. These fritters are best enjoyed fresh, as they are naturally moist from the apples."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these apple fritters completely sugar-free?",
      "answer": "No, they are not completely sugar free since they contain apples which have naturally occurring sugars. However, the recipe is added sugar free and refined sugar free. If you add a sweetener of your choice on top, opt for a refined sugar free alternative if needed (check the recipe card for possible ideas!)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does this apple fritter recipe have very little batter?",
      "answer": "There should be almost equal amounts of batter to apples as the recipe is designed to be apple-forward, not batter-heavy to ensure adequate natural sweetness. The batter lightly coats and binds the diced apples rather than surrounding them like a traditional deep-fried fritter."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use stewed apples instead of fresh apples in apple fritters?",
      "answer": "You can use stewed apples, however they should contain as little liquid as possible. Too much moisture will alter the texture and structure of the fritters."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can I substitute for rice flour in these apple fritters?",
      "answer": "All purpose regular flour is the best sub for white flour and if you would like to keep the recipe gluten free a 1:1 gluten free regular flour."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are these apple fritters healthy?",
      "answer": "Yes - these apple fritters are made with better for you ingredients, baked not fried and are very low in oil. As well as being naturally sweetened if you opt for no additional sweetener."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best apples to use for apple fritters?",
      "answer": "Fuji, gala, honeycrisp, golden delicious, pink lady, jonagold, braeburn, and ambrosia apples are best for baking and they all work great in this apple fritter recipe"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are my apple fritters dry?",
      "answer": "If your mixture looks too dry, double-check that you weighed the ingredients in grams and that the apples are diced finely. If you used a cup measurement the flour or oats may have been too tightly packed in the cup. To fix a dry batter you can add an extra egg if it is very dry or a splash of milk if it is slightly dry."
    }

  "tips": [
    "This is a small-batch apple fritter recipe. Double the ingredients if you'd like a larger serving.",
    "Dice the apples very finely to help the batter bind properly and cook evenly.",
    "I use a mix of peeled and unpeeled apples for texture and natural sweetness."
