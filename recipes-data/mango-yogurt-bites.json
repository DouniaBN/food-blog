      "If you're looking for the perfect no-bake sweet treat that actually satisfies your sweet tooth, you have to try these no bake mango yogurt bites. The natural sweetness of mango paired with creamy Greek yogurt (sneaky protein + probiotics) and topped with dark chocolate is such a good combo. The richness of the 70% dark chocolate balances out the sweetness of the mango perfectly, making these one of my favourite no-bake healthy desserts.",
      "I love these all year round, but they're especially refreshing to make in the summer when you don't want to turn the oven on. Highly recommend meal prepping a batch and keeping them in the freezer for when your sweet tooth hits (just let them thaw for about 10 minutes before!). The best part? They're made with just 3 simple ingredients that you probably already have on hand."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can I make these mango yogurt bites vegan?",
      "answer": "Yes! Simply substitute the Greek yogurt with your favorite plant-based yogurt. Coconut yogurt works particularly well and complements the mango flavor beautifully."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do these mango chocolate bites last?",
      "answer": "Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 week. For best texture, serve directly from the freezer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of mold should I use?",
      "answer": "Silicone molds work best as they're easy to remove the bites from. You can also use ice cube trays or mini muffin tins lined with paper liners."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use frozen mango instead of fresh?",
      "answer": "Yes! Thaw frozen mango completely and drain excess liquid before mixing with yogurt for the best texture."
    },
    {
      "question": "What chocolate should I use?",
      "answer": "Use high-quality dark chocolate with 70% cocoa content. For refined sugar-free option, choose stevia-sweetened dark chocolate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can these be made ahead for meal prep?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These are perfect for meal prep. Make a batch and keep them in the freezer for up to a week. They make great grab-and-go summer treats."
