      "If you're looking for the perfect no-bake mango dessert that actually satisfies your sweet tooth, you have to try these no bake mango yogurt chocolate bites. The natural sweetness of mango paired with creamy Greek yogurt (sneaky protein + probiotics) and topped with dark chocolate is such a good combo. The richness of the 70% dark chocolate balances out the sweetness of the mango perfectly, making these one of my favourite easy, healthy no-bake desserts.",
      "I love these all year round, but they're especially refreshing to make in the summer when you don't want to turn the oven on. Highly recommend meal prepping a batch and keeping them in the freezer for when your sweet tooth hits (just let them thaw for about 10 minutes before!). The best part? These mango yogurt bites are made with just 3 simple ingredients that you probably already have on hand."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can I make these mango yogurt bites vegan?",
      "answer": "Yes! Simply substitute the Greek yogurt with your favorite plant-based yogurt. Coconut yogurt works particularly well and complements the mango flavour beautifully."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long do these mango chocolate bites last?",
      "answer": "Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 week. For best texture eat cold."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of mold should I use?",
      "answer": "Silicone molds work best as they're easy to remove the bites from. You can also use silicone ice cube trays!"
    },
  
    {
      "question": "What chocolate should I use?",
      "answer": "I used a high-quality dark chocolate with 70% cocoa content. Refined sugar free chocolate works great too."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can these be made ahead for meal prep?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! These are perfect for meal prep. Make a batch and keep them in the freezer for up to a week. They make great grab-and-go summer treats."
